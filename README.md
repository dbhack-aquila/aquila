Flask/Angular 4 - Skeleton
=========================

One thing to note is that flask calls Angular's index.html file located 'static/src/index.html' which serves
the angular app. It is important to note that flask finds the index.html upon building in the 'dist' directory.

Another note is that an efficient way to develop the angular flask app is to use two different terminals.
One terminal will run the server side. (to run server side: python manage.py runserver)
The second terminal will run the client side. (ng build --dev --watch)

During production this will not be necessary. Only running the flask server will be needed.

    - close terminal and reopen
    - nvm --version

Install nvm (WINDOWS):

    - https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
    - close terminal and reopen
    - nvm --version

Install node and npm (with nvm):

    - nvm install 6
    - npm -v
    - node -v

Install Angular CLI:

    - npm install -g @angular/cli
    - ng -v

Install virtualenv:

    - pip install virtualenv

VIRTUALENV MAC:

    - virtualenv env
    - source env/bin/activate

VIRTUALENV WINDOWS:

    - virtualenv env
    - cd env/Scripts
    - activate

============
Setup
============

1. open terminal
2. cd desktop
3. git clone https://github.com/hawzie197/Flask_Angular4_Skeleton.git
4. cd Flask_Angular4_Skeleton
5. create virtual environment (see below for mac vs windows)
6. pip install -r requirements.txt
7. python manage.py runserver
8. open second terminal
9. cd app/static
10. check node/npm versions (if not correct, run: nvm use 6) # import because of angular's package.json
11. npm install (get node_modules, could take a while)
12. ng build --dev --watch
13. navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Project Breakdown
============

default:

    - Contains all routes for the project. These routes serve up data from backend for
      the client side to receive.

models:

    - The models hold sqlalchemy classes. These sqlalchemy classes are ORMs or object relational
      mappers, which directory correspond to the tables in the database.

services:

    - The backend services separate out the logic from the routes and modals. These contain
      all the core backend code for manipulating data.

static:

    - The static directory contains all of Angular's client side code. The static directory
      requests and recieves information through api calls to flask's routes.

static/src/app/components:

    - The components directory contains all components composing the client side of the application.
    - To create a new component:
        - cd app/static
        - ng g component [name]

static/src/app/services:

    - The static services separate out logic from the components. They request/recieve data from
      the components and transfer it from the client side to server side through api calls to flask's routes.
    - To create a new service:
        - cd app/static
        - ng g service [name]

templates:

    - The templates hold all html templates to render. All views are handled with Angular.
      These are mostly for warnings. 404s, 403s, 500s, unauthorized, etc..
